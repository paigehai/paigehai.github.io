"I decided to pursue a cybersecurity degree, and the more time I spent in the industry, the more I fell in love with it," she explains. What started as a fascination with Caesar cipher codes at 16 evolved naturally into a career aligned with her problem-solving mindset, curiosity, and passion for continuous learning. Bree aspires to transition into penetration testing, with a focus on social engineering. "Pen-testing is one of the most challenging skills to master in cybersecurity," she says. "It requires creative, out-of-the-box thinking rather than complacency, which is something I find especially engaging." For Bree, social engineering is uniquely human, a skill that no machine can replicate.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Early in her journey, Bree noticed a contrast in her peers\u2019 responses to cyber security. She saw their decision to step away \u201chad nothing to do with my own journey,". This resilience has been a pillar of her development.\r\nInfluences on Bree\u2019s path extend beyond traditional academic routes. Her experience in sales at Super Car Holidays, where she sold luxury cars like Ferraris, provided a unique perspective. "It\u2019s one thing to stand in a room full of cybersecurity experts and explain you\u2019re trying to become an ethical hacker," she says. "It\u2019s another to do that in a room full of non-technical people.\u201d Capturing that attention \u201cultimately influenced [her] path."'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'One experience stands out as particularly formative.

She volunteers at startups, attends networking events, builds projects, documents them on LinkedIn, and participates in HackTheBox challenges and Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions. Hands-on learning drives Bree\u2019s excitement for her studies. She\u2019s particularly fascinated by AI and how it aligns with cyber security. "Getting an understanding of how AI works can greatly benefit someone\u201d in this field, she notes. Yet, she admits that reading-heavy study methods don\u2019t resonate with her.
