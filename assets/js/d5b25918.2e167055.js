This unassailable wall, my \u201cnightmare subject\u201d that couldn\u2019t possibly play a role in my education in future. I imagine she may have even laughed at the fact I had \u201creceived a maths result\u201d and was feeling excited about it rather than pure dread.

There was, in fact, one particular experience that solidified my withdrawal from maths, a moment in which I had developed an evolutionary switch to tune out any discussion of numbers and equations."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I often think back to that year, Year 10 where the limits to my patience and self-belief were constantly being pushed. I do admit that it was a mix of things that lead to my pessimistic mindset, one being my own stubborn resistance, and all the casual distractions I occupied my time, showcasing a student with a lack of interest, never potential. At this point, my habits had led me to fall behind in my understanding yet rather than take accountability, I simply sat at the back of the classroom, laptop open, laughing quietly with friends. Yes, I was THAT classmate. Guilty."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I understand why my teacher had his frustrations towards me, as I wasn\u2019t exactly a model student. However, halfway through the year, a change took place. I knew deep down within my heart that I wanted to take a different approach, and finally try! Inspired by the efforts I was putting into both my English and Arts subjects, I wanted to stop hiding behind a nonchalant attitude. I packed up my desk, and moved to a table at the front of the class, hoping I could still catch an opportunity to immerse myself in the lessons."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There was a moment that has lingered with me going on 10 years now, whereby in my struggling efforts to catch-up, I had asked my teacher for help.

With this experience, I created a self-imposed limitation purely born out of a story with a sour ending and avoided maths altogether. And so, I engrossed myself in Literature and my love for language where I felt at home and where my efforts felt appreciated and acknowledged."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Reflecting on this journey and the release of my results, I came to realise something profound about this entire experience: no one is truly \u2018unteachable\u2019. The labels we place on ourselves, or worse\u2014 the labels placed on us by others\u2014 do not define what we are truly capable of achieving. It took me ten years to conclude that my teacher\u2019s words, whilst harmful, did not determine my abilities. It is simply one perspective that I had perhaps internalised way too quickly. It is due to the guidance and support from the Deakin University mathematics department that allowed me to break free from these limitations."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"What I\u2019ve learnt is that being \u2018unteachable\u2019 is simply a myth, a construct that holds people back from realising their true potential.

Our progress as life-long learners is often energised by the support of others, and especially by those who see our potential even when we begin to doubt ourselves."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In many beautiful ways, this result represents more than just a grade, or a number on a screen; its a testament to a journey of being \u2018unteachable\u2019 to flourishing into an active learner.
