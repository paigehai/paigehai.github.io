It "was very cool, which I still think the same about," she says. However, her curious mind led her toward a more strategic approach.

"This is something I am still struggling with, but hope to overcome it soon."'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Her experience at Melbourne Institute of Technology presented additional obstacles. As the primary campus was based in Sydney, Melbourne students sometimes faced delays or limitations in accessing academic and technical resources.

She would have built home labs or gained hands-on experience immediately after learning each topic, recognising that visual and practical simulation greatly deepens understanding.

Most importantly, she would develop people and communication skills from the start, acknowledging that "cybersecurity ultimately starts and ends with people."'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Her advice to those beginning to explore the field is rooted in thorough preparation: research different areas of cyber security, speak with professionals from various sectors to understand their day-to-day roles, and read foundational resources to identify a clear and informed learning path."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'For universities, Raya envisions a pedagogical shift. "I would place greater emphasis on current real-world incidents and teach by mapping them to existing security frameworks, so learning is based on understanding and context rather than memorisation".
