Initially, I struggled quite a lot to get over the steep learning curve of C#, and C++. My aversion to it was largely attributed to my confusion to its structure. It always felt like no matter how many program I was creating, I wasn\u2019t quite grasping the fundamental composition. With a background in graphic design, I adore creating structured designs that serve a clear purpose and so grappling with what I thought was a lack of design convention was difficult. As it turns out, I just didn\u2019t dive deep enough yet!"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Starting with C++ was such a blessing, however at the time I was not a fan, as I felt it had a lack of rules with a lot of its functions.

However, this one was different (it\u2019s not like other programs!!)."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"How did one little program change my entire perspective on programming as a whole?

I finally saw my purpose in this project as a result of the introduction of structured design principles in programming.

Abstracting all the important features from the main program made it much more visually cohesive with each state class being clearly structured."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Implementing this design aspect made the coding simpler, however creating unit tests for each and every aspect was the most challenging part of the process.
