Like Kenjaku exploiting Gojo's trust, threat actors manipulate human behaviour to bypass even the strongest systems.

He does not rely on brute force. He exploits trust, familiarity, and perception. By perfectly impersonating Geto, he creates hesitation and doubt even in Gojo, one of the strongest sorcerers alive.

In both Jujutsu Kaisen and cyber security, the strength of a system depends on the network of trust and reliance that supports it. Human factors are often the weakest link.
