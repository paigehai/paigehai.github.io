As a second-year student who balances studies with social events and networking, I\u2019ve picked up a wealth of knowledge about the tech industry and discovered practical methods to help you stand out when applying for roles.

Although the ticket prices may seem steep, there are many organisations that sponsor students or offer discounted entry to such events. Conventions you may be interested in include CyberCon, BSides, and AusCERT, all of which provide many opportunities to cross paths with some amazing individuals and start some great conversations.

I highly encourage all of my fellow students to create or contribute to projects within your specialisation.

The experience and growth you will gain from these opportunities will be valuable ten-fold. It is true that you miss all the shots you don\u2019t take. There are plenty of opportunities including volunteering with Deakin that will make you stand out, such as Open Days, career expos, or IT workshops and other School of IT initiatives.
